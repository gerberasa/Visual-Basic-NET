' Attempt to do some file processing.
' This can cause a number of potential exceptions.
' Note that you can use the specific exceptions to get extra information about that exception,

Try
File.Create("c:/temp/test.txt")  ' Can fail for a number of reasons

Catch ioe As System.IO.IOException ' This error may occur if the Temp folder does not exist.
Console.WriteLine("An IO error occurred. The c:\temp folder does not exist")

Catch se As System.Security.SecurityException ' You do not have the appropriate permission
                                              ' to take this action.
Console.WriteLine("You don't have the security permissions to take this action!")

Catch e As Exception    ' Catch all other exceptions.
Console.WriteLine( e.ToString() )  ' Print the standard exception information.
End Try
